        	<h2>What to Expect</h2>
            <p>During the week, the West Loop and River North are bustling with activity. Try to avoid driving downtown during the week at rush hour. On the weekends, the area slowly wakes up and is in a full-on frenzy by 11pm. Except during the winter. The winter frenzy is more of a coffee clatch. Here are some nice attractions to check out during the week.</p>

        	<h2>Join the Fun</h2>
            <p>During the day, you will fit in if you walk briskly, with purpose. Appear to be a pleasant sort of person, and practice common courtesy. Most Chicagoans are polite and will sometimes hold conversations with strangers. Stand off to the side to take pictures if the sidewalks are crowded and watch your step because there is uneven pavement, potholes, and dog poop everywhere. </p>

        	<h2>Night and Day</h2>
            <p>The nightlife in this part of town is exciting and expensive. Parking is usually valet and costs about $15 with a tip. If you are dining with friends, you may want to carry some cash so you can pay your tab when its time to go meet your other friends. Drink responsibly, and enjoy every drop of your $15 Manhattan.</p>
