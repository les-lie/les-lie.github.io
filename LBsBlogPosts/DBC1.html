        <h1> I AM LESLIE </h1>
            <strong><p>I was born in Omaha, NE. I was really small when I was born, and in my early days I would not eat very much food. I guess I really didn't see the point. Either that or I wasn't that hungry.</p> </strong>
            <a href="http://www.alegentcreighton.com/body.cfm?id=264&action=detail&clinic_ref=426"> This links to the hospital where I was born </a>
        <h2> I got bigger.</h2>
            <p> <em>One day, my grandmother decided enough was enough. She decided to go ahead and put a whole bunch of frosting around my mouth. My mom was upset (HI MOM!), but that did the trick. I've been eating frosting ever since.</em> </p>
            <a href="http://www.memecenter.com/fun/1510691/bad-ass-baby"> I was an unreasonable baby.</a>
        <h2> I have a sweet tooth. A horrible sweet tooth. </h2>
            <p> Sometimes, I will ask people if they want cupcakes for their birthday. 99% of the time, I have an ulterior motive.<br> I will buy my friends six cupcakes from Sprinkles.</br> I will usually also buy three for myself.</p>
            <a href="mailto:lesliemariebell@gmail.com">If you love cupcakes too, please send me an email.</a>
