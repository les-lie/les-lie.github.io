      <p>Kickstarter is a site where users can describe an innovation, product, project, or idea to the public to solicit sponsorship in the form of a donation. In exchange for the donation, the users offer incentives to the donors. The projects vary in scope and goals, but all of them have a fundraising time limit and a clearly stated purpose for the donations. I enjoy visiting Kickstarter every couple weeks to see what is new in the world of crowdsourced innovation. I like seeing the new ideas and clever products people post and I admire the ingenuity of the artisans found on the site. <br></br>The site is relatively simple with very few fussy elements. It is designed to appeal to people with all levels of technical expertise as the intent is to present the campaigns to as many people as possible to assist the owners in reaching their financial goals. Page navigation is simple and follows a logical flow. There is a search tool as well as an option for donors to create an account to keep track of projects they are interested in. After spending time on the site, I am awed at both the genius of the innovators and saddened by the worthy projects that appear to be falling short of their goals. Kickstarter will only release the donated funds if the project meets its stated financial goal, so there are many ambitious and worthy projects that come so close, but unfortunately fall short of the mark and may never make it to production.  I usually donate to one or two Kickstarter projects a month, though I would love to sponsor more. </p>

      <p>Etsy is like an online arts and crafts fair where sellers can operate their own online storefronts and sell their handmade and vintage items and supplies. Or, at least it used to be. I enjoy browsing Etsy frequently because I like supporting independent retailers and I love unique handcrafted items. These days, there are sellers on Etsy who tend to use it as a retail outlet that supports other ventures and all products posted in the stores may not be homemade or handmade. Etsy does filter results up front based on how products are made, but even still, customers must use their best judgement and read product descriptions closely.

      The Etsy Interface is clean and inviting. The webpage is designed in muted tones and soft colors contrasted with bold images of handcrafted items and craftspeople at work. The aesthetic is very calming. I think they want to transport the customer to a shipowners craft room or workshop where they are diligently working away on finishing up your customized item. When Etsy was launched in 2005, it was groundbreaking because it offered sellers of homemade items a low cost way of promoting their products worldwide. <br></br>Almost all of my friends started making jewelry, greeting cards, lotions and potions- it was a boom time for home-based business and talented craftspeople. Many sellers such as Anderson Soap Company were able to launch their products into the full retail market based on their Etsy shop. Searching Etsy can be tricky because simple searches often yield thousands of results, but with the right keywords, you can find exactly what you are looking for. I love shopping on Etsy, especially for candles, scarves, headbands, perfume, and jewelry. I think it is cool to buy items that cannott be bought in a store with the added benefit of supporting a person who works to produce a quality product they are willing to stand behind. Etsy has a wonderful feedback and seller communication platform, so with few exceptions, buyers know what to expect when they are making a purchase. I usually buy a few items a month on Etsy, mostly for myself, but also gifts that are always cherished and appreciated for their originality and aesthetic.</p>

      <p>Photography is a hobby of mine- I wish I could dedicate more time to it. When I cannot get out to shoot, I love scrolling down the Flickr homepage for a few minutes and admiring the artistry of other shooters. Flickr is sort of a social network driven by photographic images and the feedback they receive. The Flickr layout is not anything special- the amazing content is what sets it apart.   The flickr team selects 500+ photos each day to appear on the Flickr homepage. These 500 photos are selected because they are interesting, remarkable, and have universal appeal. For a photographer, having one of your images selected for the Explore page is an honor, and getting an image noticed by the editors is often discussed in forums all over the web. <br></br>I like photos of animals, of course, and unique nature shots, but I also am getting into High Dynamic Range or HDR photography, where multiple exposures of the same photo are combined to highlight the light and dark elements and create a composite image that is sharp, colorful, attention-grabbing, and eye-true. The photos, when done properly, give the viewer the feeling of being in the shot. When not rendered well, the photos look odd and cartoonish, which I can actually appreciate sometimes. While there are some photographers who use Getty Images to license their work through Flickr and make money, most of the photography is offered under a Creative Commons license.</p>
