		<h2><a href="#">Week 1 Cultural Reflections</a></h2>
		
		<p>I was encouraged by the openness with which Shereef approached the fireside chat. I can tell that he is passionate about educating students to become good amateur programmers. His description of how the program has been refined and improved from the first cohort to the current class shows that he is truly present with the students, and strangely, I trust him even though we've never met. His communication style during the chat was direct and factual, yet also kind and caring. My understanding of taking on the DBC challenge has changed so much from the first day I learned about the program. Before I hear the chat, I had cycled from fear and anxiety to regret, to excitement and happiness, back to fear, to dread, back to excitement and anticipation, etc. His chat solidified in my mind that even though this is going to be a real uphill slog at times and probably one of the more difficult efforts of my life, it is that way for one reason- to make me well-rounded programmer.<br>

		Despite the fact that I have no idea what to expect at DBC on a day to day basis, listening to his chat has given me the confidence that I can make it and thrive if I approach DBC with the right energy and mindset. While I am accustomed to high-pressure intense environments, I am usually the expert, not the student. I don't know how I am going to adjust to that other than to keep an open mind, focus, and be kind to myself.  <br>

		I came into the program expecting only to learn Ruby in 9 weeks. DBC is so much more than learning Ruby on Rails! The opportunities presented for the boots are extremely valuable, and I plan to take full advantage of the culture and environment to learn as much as I can in my 9 short weeks onsite.</p>
